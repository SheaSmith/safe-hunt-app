PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED BEFORE I FORGET:
- Map Issues. Lack of polygon + iOS support in Mapbox, switch to another
	-> Lack of offline support in new one + slow raster tiles + doesn't handle zooming in very well
	-> Switch back to mapbox - implemented polygon support myself, along with some experimental code online

Cache didn't work well
	-> Built own cache to own spec rather relying on 3rd party libraries that aren't well supported

Built 'own' map base for offline support due to large size of proper LINZ maps

Issues with LINZ map - experimenting with different systems

Database storage - How do we store polygons?

Background image with keyboard moving
	-> Special decoration layer

Platform Based UI

Imported hunting blocks - wrong coordinates system

GeoJSON too long, polyline implementation

Low quality thumbs
